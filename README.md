# Capstone Project
## Project Name (and version)

Personal Review version 1.0.1

## Technology Stack
MERN (Mongo Express React Node)

## Project Purpose

Many people want to review the goods and services they buy or use from individuals online, but there is no public platform where they may do so.
The goal of this project is to develop a website where customers can go and post reviews of individuals who offer services both online and offline, such as when someone develops your website's logo or writes a book.
Its uniqueness comes from the fact that in the future, anyone can just visit the platform and read all the reviews about a person for what they have accomplished. They can also use the open API that will be made available to obtain these reviews.

To verify the information posted, every user will register for an account, and their phone number will be verified using a One-Time Password. Aside from that, human administrators will be able to remove inappropriate reviews.
I only allow one review to be posted on someone’s profile every 24 hours.

## Narrative Description

`David was very happy with the logo Lebron made for his website and wanted to let people know about it. He registered for an account on personalreview.ssekalegga.ca and searched for Lebron. He clicked on his name from the result because Lebron had already created his profile on personal review. He then composed his review by clicking “Leave your review.” He selected his star rating.
When Lebron was asked for a recommendation from his new client, Florence, Lebron logged into his personal review account  clicked on “My Profile,” and copied a shareable link and sent it to Florence.
Florence opened the link, and she was able to read all the reviews of Lebron even without registering for an account.
